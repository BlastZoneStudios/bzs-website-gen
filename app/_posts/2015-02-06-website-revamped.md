title: Website Revamped!
---

We have been long overdue for a new website. And it's finally here! It contains
all the old stuff from our previous site, but it has quite a bit more added
functionality. You guys may not notice too much in terms of features, but on
the backend, the site has been completely revamped using [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io),
[Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/), [Bower](http://bower.io/), and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).
It's pretty much a ton of stuff that will make our jobs as content producers much easier.
I will create an article detailing this process in hopes of inspiring you guys
to switch over!

 Stay tuned in the next few weeks as we will begin ramping up blog posts, tutorials
 and of course software production!
