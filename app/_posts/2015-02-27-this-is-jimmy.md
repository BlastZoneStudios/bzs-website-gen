Greetings! My name is Jimmy, and I am the other half of this operation. While Steven generally provides the comic relief and motivation, my focus has been more on the technical side of things.

It has been almost two years since we've started Blast Zone Studios, and we still have much more to do. My main focus for this year includes:

- **Learn** more about design and user experience
- **Teach** others about game development
- **Become** more involved with development communities

I'm hoping I can achieve this by making games, writing tutorials, making presentations, and participating in meetups and hackathons.

If you see me, feel free to come to me and say hi. I won't bite, I promise!
